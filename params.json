  "body": "#3 things about me\r\n\r\n##Passionate\r\nI'm passionate. I've started MVMS Programming Club, a non-profit organization that teaches programming to students and I'm part of Catalyst 4 Success, another non profit that encourages STEM careers towards elementary students. This summer, I'm teaching students how to code through introductory coding camps.\r\n\r\n<i>I love to teach, and I love to learn.</i>\r\n\r\n##Driven\r\nI'm driven. I've built 3 apps in one year, and I found a way to incorporate my love of App Development in my English class, and thus I built [iMedici] (https://github.com/ronakdev/hh-google-20), which puts the user through the Renaissance to fully understand the impact of the Medicis.\r\n\r\nAnother app i built is [Swift Planner] (http://appstore.com/swiftplanner), an app designed to defeat procrastination by allowing users to get the option to \"snooze\" homework assignments.\r\n\r\nMy last app is [Multiplication Tables] (http://appstore.com/MultiplicationTables-LearnTimesTables), an app that teaches multiplication tables towards young kids in a simple, easy to learn method.\r\n\r\nI have acquired over 2000 downloads on my apps so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Resilient\r\nI don't give up easily. When I started programming in 7th grade, I hated it. I was annoyed that it wasn't easy (I was good at math, so this was confusing), and I hated myself for being unable to accomplish the programming tasks. However, I realized that programming was simply a really difficult puzzle, and thus I approached my problems better, and I chose to view the situations and tasks before me in a different, more logical approach. I've taken this logic-based approach and applied it towards all my classes, whether it be in APCS understanding Binary trees, or in AP European History, understanding Napoleon's decisions. Either way, I don't give up, and use my knowledge and logic to get me through even the toughest of problems.\r\n\r\n#Dreams\r\n\r\nI'm most excited to get together with like minded people to create the ideas I've been forced to hold in my mind. I can't wait to push the limits of what apps and other technologies can do.\r\n\r\nOne idea that I have is a bendable phone that can extend to the size of an iPad, but fits into your pocket as an iPhone. Boasting a UI as easy to use as iOS and as sophisticated as Android, this would be the SuperPhone.\r\n",
