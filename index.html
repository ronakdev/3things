<a id="3-things-about-me" class="anchor" href="#3-things-about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3 things about me</h1>

<h2>
<a id="passionate" class="anchor" href="#passionate" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Passionate</h2>

<p>I'm passionate. I've started MVMS Programming Club, a non-profit organization that teaches programming to students and I'm part of Catalyst 4 Success, another non profit that encourages STEM careers towards elementary students. This summer, I'm teaching students how to code through introductory coding camps.</p>

<p><i>I love to teach, and I love to learn.</i></p>

<h2>
<a id="driven" class="anchor" href="#driven" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Driven</h2>

<p>I'm driven. I've built 3 apps in one year, and I found a way to incorporate my love of App Development in my English class, and thus I built <a href="https://github.com/ronakdev/hh-google-20">iMedici</a>, which puts the user through the Renaissance to fully understand the impact of the Medicis.</p>

<p>Another app i built is <a href="http://appstore.com/swiftplanner">Swift Planner</a>, an app designed to defeat procrastination by allowing users to get the option to "snooze" homework assignments.</p>

<p>My last app is <a href="http://appstore.com/MultiplicationTables-LearnTimesTables">Multiplication Tables</a>, an app that teaches multiplication tables towards young kids in a simple, easy to learn method.</p>

<p>I have acquired over 2000 downloads on my apps so far.</p>

<h2>
<a id="resilient" class="anchor" href="#resilient" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resilient</h2>

<p>I don't give up easily. When I started programming in 7th grade, I hated it. I was annoyed that it wasn't easy (I was good at math, so this was confusing), and I hated myself for being unable to accomplish the programming tasks. However, I realized that programming was simply a really difficult puzzle, and thus I approached my problems better, and I chose to view the situations and tasks before me in a different, more logical approach. I've taken this logic-based approach and applied it towards all my classes, whether it be in APCS understanding Binary trees, or in AP European History, understanding Napoleon's decisions. Either way, I don't give up, and use my knowledge and logic to get me through even the toughest of problems.</p>

<h1>
<a id="dreams" class="anchor" href="#dreams" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dreams</h1>

<p>I'm most excited to get together with like minded people to create the ideas I've been forced to hold in my mind. I can't wait to push the limits of what apps and other technologies can do.</p>

<p>One idea that I have is a bendable phone that can extend to the size of an iPad, but fits into your pocket as an iPhone. Boasting a UI as easy to use as iOS and as sophisticated as Android, this would be the SuperPhone.</p>
